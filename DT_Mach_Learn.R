# Values are .7 and .3 which is the split of independent variable (i.e. at highest level 30% default)
# We then break by checking_balance into two categories (from four)
# If not those things then only .14 default (which is 46% of node population)
# If you have a poor credit history then you will be .69 likelihood at the bottom, but either way not good

# Can control your own tree, rpart itself will use complexity
# check the help file but this one says a minimum of 10 items before can split, seeking to control over-fitting

#### Random Forest ####

# Often a single tree isn't so great for prediction errors

# Looking at RF and Boosting

boston <- Boston

# Create a training set

set.seed(101)
train = sample(1:nrow(boston), 300)

# medv = is the median value of owner-occupied homes, and other stats are about the suburbs of poston
# Runs a random forest (regression with 500 trees)
# MSR and % variance are based on out of bag estimates
# mtry us the tuning argument, which is the number of variables selected when you make a split

rf.boston = randomForest(medv~., data = boston, subset = train)
rf.boston

# for a series of random forests, here we are using 13 variables so mtry from 1 to 13
# to record errors set up two variables oob.err and test.err
# loop mtry from 1 to 13 and restrict number of trees to 350
# extract the MSE and predict, and compute test error

oob.err = double(13)
test.err = double(13)
for(mtry in 1:13){
  fit = randomForest(medv~., data = boston, subset=train, mtry=mtry, ntree = 350)
  oob.err[mtry] = fit$mse[350]
  pred = predict(fit, boston[-train,])
  test.err[mtry] = with(boston[-train,], mean( (medv-pred)^2 ))
}

# 4550 trees (13 x 350)
# matplot plot, bind the oob and test into a matrix, pch = diamon, colours = red and blue, type equals both (lines and points)

matplot(1:mtry, cbind(test.err, oob.err), pch = 23, col = c("red", "blue"), type = "b", ylab="Mean Squared Error")
legend("topright", legend = c("OOB", "Test"), pch = 23, col = c("red", "blue"))

# Ideally the two curves would line up but test error is a bit lower
# there is a lot of variability in the test error estimate
# OOB was on one dataset and test error on other, the differences are within the standard errors
# Red and blue are correlated, mtry of 4 looks optimal for test error
# Since tree has 26 MSE, and you can get to 15 with four tiers

# Using previous methodology  - don't think can tree with all that numerical


#### Boosting ####

# Boosting grows smaller and stubbier trees
# Gaussian distribution with squared error loss, 10000 shallow trees with 4 split in each, shrinkage is 0.01

boost.boston = gbm(medv~. -h_medv, data = boston[train,], distribution = "gaussian", n.trees = 10000, shrinkage = 0.01, interaction.depth = 4)
summary(boost.boston)

# the resultant plot gives you variable importance- here is rm (number of rooms) and lstat (% of lower status indivs)
# plot those

plot(boost.boston,i="lstat")
plot(boost.boston,i="rm")

# Shows the higher the p. of lower status, the lower the housing price & reversed for rooms

# To apply to the test dataset
# Grid of trees in steps of 100 to 10000
# Predict using the boosted model with n.trees as argument
# dimensions of matrix are 206 test observations and 100 different predict vectors on 100 different values of tree

n.trees = seq(from = 100, to = 10000, by = 100)
predmat = predict(boost.boston, newdata = boston[-train,], n.trees = n.trees)
dim(predmat)

# Compute the test error
# predmat is a matrix, medv is a vector (so predmat - medv) is a matrix of differences
# Use apply function to the colums of those square differences (the mean) to compute the column-wise squared error for the predict vectors
# Plot using similar parameters to one used for random forest, and a boosting error plot show

boost.err = with(boston[-train,], apply( (predmat - medv)^2, 2, mean) )
plot(n.trees, boost.err, pch = 23, ylab = "Mean Squared Error", xlab = "# Trees", main = "Boosting Test Error")
abline(h = min(test.err), col = "red")

# Boosting error really drops with the volume f trees
# Shows boosting is reluctant to over-fit
# Can see that test error for boosting does get below the test error for random forest (red line)
